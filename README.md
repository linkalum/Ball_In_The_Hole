About building the game:
  
    The code for the main application is in the folder code.main, there you can find the source (src folder), the images (imagenes = images folder), the library used (lib folder). The other files are settings for ECLIPSE, you can use them, but you don't have to. For compiling and tesing the program on your own computer using ECLIPSE follow the next steps.

    - Create a new Java Project (usually called Ball_In_The_Hole, but you can name it in your computer as you wish). The code was build using JDK 1.7 but works fine in JDK 1.6 too.

    - Copy the folders src, imagenes and lib directly to the program folder. As your program is empty you can override the src folder (don't worry about the error on the src folder, we fix in the next step).

    - Open the lib folder on your Package explorer (usualy left sided), click the right button on paneles-vista.jar and select Build Path, and then Add to Build Path. Now the library paneles-vista.jar is built.

    - On the Package Explorer open the src folder, then open the game package. There you will find the Start.java file, which holds the main method for running the game. Open this file and then press the green play button (or Ctrl+F11).

    - The program will start, for begin a new game you should click on the white button called Nueva Partida (new game in spanish). For accelerate the ball press 'I' and for break it press 'K'. For turn in clockwise direction press 'L', and in counterclockwise direction press 'J'.
